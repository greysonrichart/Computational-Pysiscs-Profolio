# Computational-Pysiscs-Profolio
 This is the end of the semester profolio for Greyson Richart for PHY2200
 In it you will find three project. 
	My first Project: Breakdown
	A Mid-semester Project: Magnus Effect
	My Final Project:Paper Toss

  In Breakdown me and a fellow classmate Nick Radar worked together to make a the game
  its main physical commponent is the collitions that go on in the game. They are elestic
  collitions thus there is no loss in momentum during the collision. Overall it is a fun
  game and you should try and play it. 

  In the Magnus Effect project it focuses mainly on data collection. In it I test which
  angles are the best to hit a baseball at with different types of spin on the ball. the
  main physics behind it is in fact the magnus effect. 

  In my final project paper toss I made a game controller using a simple ardiuno with
  with the help of a good friend named Emily L.(picture in the papertoss folder) In the game you use the controller to
  move the ball and shoot it. There was supposed to be a fan but it didnt implement
  well so i deleted it from the game but left the physics behind it still.

  I hope you enjoy the repo :D
